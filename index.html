Even though you might feel like your freshman year of college has not been as successful as you wanted it to be, it is important to reflect on the progress and accomplishments you have made since the beginning. You are doing well academically, getting used to living on your own as an adult, and making new friends. You even managed to land a job with the Asian Pacific Islander Student Programs office, which will bring you many cherished and important memories in the future. Not a bad first year at all.
	But outside of these things, I know how you feel. There are times when you still feel lost, insecure, and inadequate when dealing with the responsibilities given to you. Despite improving your work habits in college, there are still times when you feel you are not working as efficiently or effectively as you thought you would. Sometimes you have trouble balancing your work with your personal life. And while you recognize these issues, it is important to actively try to address them too.
	To help with the feelings of lostness and insecurity, it is important to recognize the support group you have around you. For academic purposes, do not be afraid to consult with your counselor. They know way more than you about classes, schedules, and any sort of questions you might have regarding school, so do not feel like you have to bear the weight of figuring everything out by yourself. Not only can they answer your questions, but they can guide you in the right direction for a successful future. Career-wise, consider opening yourself up to meeting more new people for networking purposes. Even though you are kind of introverted, meeting new people will inevitably open more doors for you. The experiences and insights you will gain from these new connections and opportunities will help guide you towards the right career goals, as I know you are still not entirely sure on what you want to do with your life. And socially, start reaching out to your friends more. Try not to be so timid and wait for them to reach out to you. If you want to hang out, take the initiative to reach out yourself and stop shying away from your made up excuses.
	As for your work habits, realize that while you have improved since high school, there is still room for improvement. Though you may be more disciplined than you were before, you still could be better with forcing yourself to stick to schedules. Try being more punctual with your self-set deadlines, and do your best not to allow yourself to slack off. And while the Canvas calendar is handy, try using a real calendar or agenda to schedule out your week in a more effective way. Be more organized, use different colors or bold certain parts of your notes to help guide your mind. Study ahead of time, and make sure to read your texts. Even though you hate reading the countless pages your professors assign you, they only help make your assignments easier. You have come a long way in terms of study habits, but there is still room to grow. Try not to take it as a source of discouragement, but rather motivate yourself to change these flaws.
